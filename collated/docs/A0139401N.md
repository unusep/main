### Review of [Trello](https://trello.com/)
#### Strengths:
- Online/Cloud based program that allows it to be transferrable to other computers.
- Ease to add in notes and description into Trello cards.
- Customizable looks.

#### Weaknesses:
- It cannot link up with other calendar software like Google calendar, which makes it hard to keep track of tasks done.
- The free version is much more limited than the paid version, making certain customisation features difficult to accomplish.
