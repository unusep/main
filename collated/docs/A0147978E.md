### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the application and updates the UI accordingly.

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Do-er List data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' (E.g. the UI can be bound to this list) so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Review of [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/):
#### Strengths:
- Desktop software is provided, so we can launch it quickly without using a browser.
- Shortcuts for opening the software is provided, so that the todo lists can be opened quickly to those who prefer using the keyboard.
- User can create their own categories for tasks and allocate tasks to different categories.
- Elegant GUI is provided; the UI is not wordy and icons are quite intuitively.

#### Weaknesses:
- Network connection is required. If there is no network connection, the software even cannot be opened.
- The `parser` for input text can only deal with simple command.  
	- E.g. Adding the start time of event. If the command cannot be recognized, it will be automatically added as task title.
