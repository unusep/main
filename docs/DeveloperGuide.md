## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This application will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer.
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above).
2. Click `File` > `Import`.
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`.
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
5. Click `Finish`.

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish.
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process.)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At application launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the application's log file.

The rest of the application consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of the application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the application in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 3`.

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `DoerListChangedEvent` when the Do-er List data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the application and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
<img src="images/DeletePersonSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>

[//]: # (@@author A0147978E)
### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Do-er List data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' (E.g. the UI can be bound to this list) so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[//]: # (@@author)
### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Do-er List data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file.
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are outputted through `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but proceed with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the application.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging.
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file.
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose 
`Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire application by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests that do not involve the GUI. They include:
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest` 

   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library that we are using, our GUI tests can be run in _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on his computer while the tests are running.<br>

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repository with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Do-er List depends on the [Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repository (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download the necessary libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix E : Product Survey

[//]: # (@@author A0147978E)
### Review of [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/):
#### Strengths:
- Desktop software is provided, so we can launch it quickly without using a browser.
- Shortcuts for opening the software is provided, so that the todo lists can be opened quickly to those who prefer using the keyboard.
- User can create their own categories for tasks and allocate tasks to different categories.
- Elegant GUI is provided; the UI is not wordy and icons are quite intuitively.

#### Weaknesses:
- Network connection is required. If there is no network connection, the software even cannot be opened.
- The `parser` for input text can only deal with simple command.  
	- E.g. Adding the start time of event. If the command cannot be recognized, it will be automatically added as task title.

[//]: # (@@author)
### Review of [WunderList](https://www.wunderlist.com/zh/):
#### Strengths:
- Ease of usage is the biggest strength. A user can easily add multiple items just by entering his desired items.
- Apple Watch integration is a nice bonus for Apple Watch owners.
- Slick user interface that allows background customizations.

#### Weaknesses:
- The free version has very limited features. Users only get 25 assigns per shared to-do list and 10 background choices.
- A constant network connection is required. If there is no network connection, the software cannot be opened.
- Wunderlist lacks IFTTT integration compared to other to-do list applications.

[//]: # (@@author A0139401N)
### Review of [Trello](https://trello.com/)
#### Strengths:
- Online/Cloud based program that allows it to be transferrable to other computers.
- Ease to add in notes and description into Trello cards.
- Customizable looks.

#### Weaknesses:
- It cannot link up with other calendar software like Google calendar, which makes it hard to keep track of tasks done.
- The free version is much more limited than the paid version, making certain customisation features difficult to accomplish.

[//]: # (@@author A0139168W)
### Review of [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
#### Strengths:
- Adds different kind of colouring to the schedule.
- Undo addition or deletion of events.
- Create multiple calendar for different purposes.
- GUI is quite intuitive. The formatting is clear and it does not require guidelines.
- Able to use calendar in offline mode.


#### Weaknesses:
- Unable to view all deleted events or reminders.
- It does not have command-line inputs to modify the calendar; most operations require a user to click, which can be time-consuming.
- Only accessible via browsers; no desktop application available.
